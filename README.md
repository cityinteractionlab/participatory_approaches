# What is this repository for?
The repository to document the participatory approaches, methodologies to study them and workshops organized.
The main idea behind the co-production workshops is to co-design solutions and make analysis of sustainability issues fostering collective intelligence. 

## Background on participatory approaches 

Public engagement in the research process can be used to increase the scale and impact of research, engage citizens in scientific research, and address scientific questions by having large amounts of data. However, the involvement of the public in the steps is often limited to data collection and is rarely involved in the other steps of the research process (Skarlatidou et al. 2021). 

## Literature 

Some papers and write-ups on participatory projects at different scales:

- participatory rural approaches with great overview of methods (actual even now) https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0305750X94901414
- recent paper by Utrecht University colleagues: Power and politics in stakeholder engagement: farm dweller (in)visibility and conversions to game farming in South Africa
- citizen science projects and local urbanism perspectives https://liubauer.medium.com/notes-on-local-and-global-actions-in-our-cities-citizen-science-community-e0709d490fe6
