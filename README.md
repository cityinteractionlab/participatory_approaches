# What is the aim of the project and repository?
The repository documents several participatory approaches frameworks, literature and methodologies to study them and workshops organized using these methodologies in various context.
The main idea behind the co-production workshops is to co-design solutions and make analysis of sustainability issues fostering collective intelligence. 
Some examples of projects like this include a) citizen science activities such as https://github.com/correlaid-paris/citizen_science_inaturalist, b) places making workshops https://github.com/Liyubov/placemaking_analysis, c) current projects with communities and documentation of them

## Background on participatory approaches 

Public engagement in the research process can be used to increase the scale and impact of research, engage citizens in scientific research, and address scientific questions by having large amounts of data. However, the involvement of the public in the steps is often limited to data collection and is rarely involved in the other steps of the research process (Skarlatidou et al. 2021). 

## Literature and reading list   


Papers, books, reports  on participatory projects can be devided into two groups:
1. Academic literature on co-production during participatory projects 
2. Hands-on reports 

We hence structure the literature to these two groups:

1. Academic literature:
- #antrhopology such as participatory rural approaches with great overview of methods (actual even now) https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0305750X94901414
- #computer science, #participatorymodeling participatory modeling (Bousquet et Le Page, 2004)
- #antrhopology, #economics, #sociology recent paper by Utrecht University colleagues: Power and politics in stakeholder engagement: farm dweller (in)visibility and conversions to game farming in South Africa
- #citizenscience, #urbanism projects and local urbanism perspectives https://liubauer.medium.com/notes-on-local-and-global-actions-in-our-cities-citizen-science-community-e0709d490fe6
- #participatory projects such as seminal papers on Revisiting the Commons: Local Lessons, Global Challenges by Elinor Ostrom et al. in 1999 where the authors discuss main challenges faced by various collectives in common decision making process 

2. Hands-on approaches:
- Nesta report on participatory methods, OpenCovid and related practices for collaborations
- SALT approach, which tries to invest into the participatory techniques and building community ownership https://the-constellation.org/india-salt-and-on-alcoholism-and-bonded-labour-in-participatory-action-research/
- COMMOD, ARDI frameworks as more advanced techniques for assisting participatory modeling (Ettiene et al. 2014)
- thriving earth exchange program published various reports on their activites  https://thrivingearthexchange.org/

## Scheme of the participatory projects 

From a broader perspective participatory and citizen science projects can be described using the following diagram.
We propose a circular scheme for participatory projects which allows for keeping knowledge production active and in the curated cycle.
