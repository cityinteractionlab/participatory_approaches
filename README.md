## Background on participatory approaches 

Public engagement in the research process can be used to increase the scale and impact of research, engage citizens in scientific research, and address scientific questions by having large amounts of data. However, the involvement of the public in the steps is often limited to data collection and is rarely involved in the other steps of the research process (Skarlatidou et al. 2021).
